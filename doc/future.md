Future
======

- More persistence options.

- Fail-over. Robustness.

- Interoperable client and server implementations in C, Python, Go, Elixir?

- UDP multicast to further reduce the bottleneck in the message sequencer. Maybe use zeromq's multicast.

- Tupelo as a service; specialized and replicated subspace managers as services.
