Subspace examples
-----------------

The examples in this dir show how to use subspaces to reduce bandwidth and storage requirements. Also, a subspace that is sufficently constrained often can be stored using efficient data structures (such as rbtrees in the addr-book.rb example).

For other uses of subspaces, see also:
